<h1>Students Scores Analysis</h1>

### Introduction and Data Source
This project aims to analyze the impact of various factors on students' math, reading, and writing scores, and to find ways to enhance these scores for better future education outcomes.
The dataset was downloaded from kaggle dataset and uploaded on anaconda jupyter notebook for analysis.
The dataset comprises of gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, test preparation course, math score, reading score and writing score.

### Findings
<p>
  <li>
  <b>How effective is the test preparation course?</b>
</li>
The result strongly suggests that the test preparation course has a significant impact on the students' scores.
Students who participated in the course tend to perform differently (most likely better) than those who did not.
</p>
<p>
  <li>
  <b>Which major factor contributed to the test outcomes?</b>
</li>
<b>Math score:</b> lunch(standard) has the most positive impact on the maths scores followed by gender(male).
<br>
<b>Writing score:</b> lunch(standard) has positive impact whiles gender(male) and Test Preparation(none).
<br>
<b>Reading score:</b> lunch(standard) has positive impact while Test preparation(None) and gender(male) have negative impact on reading score.
</p>

<li>
  <b>What would be the best way to improve students scores on each test?</b>
</li>
<p><b>Math score:</b>  <br>
1. Support for Female Students. <br>
2. Nutritious Meals. <br>
3. Effective Programs. <br>
4. Parental Involvement. <br>
5. Address Racial Disparities. <br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Writing scores</b> <br>
1. Boys-only Writing Groups. <br>
2. Nutritious Meals. <br>
3. Evaluation and improvement of test preparation courses with effective writing strategies, engaging methods, and personalized study plans. <br>
4. Encourage parental involvement and offer workshops to help parents support their children's writing development. <br>
5. Address Racial Disparities.   <br>
</p>

<p>
  <b>Reading score:</b>  <br>
1. Selecting reading materials that interest boys. <br>
2. Expanding the standard lunch program. <br>
3.  Incorporating effective reading strategies and comprehension exercises. <br>
